            When running a business, you would have different types of customers; premium, loyal, one-off, active customers etc.<br>
            RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) is a technique used to group customers based on their purchasing behaviour. The different groups can then be targeted with marketing campaigns tailored to their needs.<br><br>

            1. There is a column for customer identity (e.g customer ID), order number, order date, and revenue from the order in the table.<br>

            RFM is calculated this way:<br>
            1. Recency: How long ago an order was placed by the customers in the given period of time with the most recent date as the benchmark. High recency means not too long ago and vice versa<br>
            2. Frequency: How many orders were made by the customers in the given period of time. High frequency means high number of orders and vice versa<br>
            3. Monetary Value: How much, on average, was spent by the customer per order in the given period of time. High monetary value means high price and vice versa<br>

            <strong> Real data is rarely symmetric. The median was used as an alternative to the average since it is a better statistic for skewed data.</strong>
            The recency, frequency, and monetary value are ranked on a scale of 0 to 1 each. To create categories, 0 to 0.5 is ranked as Low while above 0.5 is ranked as High. To create scores, 0 to 0.5 is assigned a value of 0 while above 0.5 is assigned a value of 1. Personas and segments are created from a combination of these categories and scores as shown below:
