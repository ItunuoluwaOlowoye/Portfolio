    st.markdown(f"""Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is used in the retail industry to know what products customers are
                buying together. Retailers can leverage this to <strong style="color:{primary_color};">cross-sell 
                products, improve customer experience, increase impulse purchases made by customers, and offer
                promotions on associated products.</strong><br>
                For in-store retailers, this means optimizing the store layout for product placement and display.
                For example, when customers buy spaghetti, they may also buy tomato soup cans with it so the store
                can display spaghetti and tomato soup cans close to each other.<br>
                For online retailers, this means personalizing suggestions to customers in the *"These products
                may also interest you", "Customers who bought this also bought...", etc.* categories. For example,
                customers who bought an iPhone 15 also bought a Lightning USB-C to iPhone charger.""",

                    first couple of months familiarizing herself with the role, she couldn't help but notice a slight 
                    disconnect. Products that naturally complemented each other were scattered across the store. A 
                    customer buying eggs, for example, had to walk to the other end of the store, if they wanted to 
                    include milk. She also noticed from the inventory that there were some products that just didn't sell
                    out fast enough.<br><br>
                    From these, she discovered that there was potential to enhance shopping experiences for their
                    customers by transforming the store layout to create "mini-environments" where related items
                    harmonised with each other. Strategically placed slow moving items with promotions could also find
                    their way into customers' baskets and reduce the inventory stock.""",
